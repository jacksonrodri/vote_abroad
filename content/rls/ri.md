New! Rhode Island now accepts voter registration and ballot requests forms as well as voted ballots from military and overseas voters by email, as well as fax and postal mail. 

If you submit your voter registration form, ballot request form, or your voted ballot electronically, you do *not* have to send in the original by postal mail.
