Illinois voters abroad need to request a ballot each calendar year you'd like to vote in. **[Click here](https://www.votefromabroad.org)** to start your ballot request now.

Check below for your delivery methods and deadlines, and to find your local election office contact information.

### Delivery Methods

* Registration: not required
* Ballot Request: email, fax, or postal mail
* Ballot Return: postal mail~

~Some county election offices have indicated that they will accept overseas ballots by email or fax. However, IL state law only allows ballots to be returned by mail. We recommend IL voters return their ballots by mail. (If you return your ballot by email or fax, we recommend you mail it in as well.)
