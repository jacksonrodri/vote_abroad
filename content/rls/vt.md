Vermont voters abroad need to request a ballot each calendar year you'd like to vote in. [**Click here**](https://www.votefromabroad.org) to start your ballot request now.

Check below for your delivery methods and deadlines, and to find your local election office contact information.

### Delivery Methods

* Registration: email, or postal mail
* Ballot Request: email, or postal mail
* Ballot Return: postal mail (NEW for 2020: email return available for overseas voters in countries with suspended mail service to the US~)

~ Military or overseas voters who are in a country for which mail service to the US has been suspended, and who have no other means of returning their ballot by mail, may return their marked ballot directly to the Clerk as a PDF or photo file attached to an email to the Clerk. _Please contact your clerk to confirm you are eligible to use email ballot return!_
