As an overseas voter, you need to send in a form to request your ballot for every calendar year in which you wish to vote. The form, the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) is only one page and will cover you for all elections in the calendar year: Primary, General and Special Elections that you may otherwise not be aware of. It’s easy to do:

Go to www.votefromabroad.org, click on “Start Here” and follow the prompts.  


Print out and sign the form.


Return the form to your US Local Election Official by mail, email or fax, using information in the Instructions from the website.  (The email, phone and fax information is on a separate page from the mailing address. Submission methods and deadlines vary by state.  The information for your state is included in the Instructions.)

If you have any questions while filling out the form, VoteFromAbroad.org has an online chat box (the orange square in the lower right corner of the screen).  

After you send the FPCA in, be sure to email or call your Local Election Official to verify they received it and will be sending a ballot to you. The applicable contact information is in the printed instructions from votefromabroad.org included with your completed form. You can also look up the contact information for your Local Election Official here: www.votefromabroad.org/vote/eod.htm?submission=true
