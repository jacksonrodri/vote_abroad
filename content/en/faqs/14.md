If you were registered to vote before you left, check your state’s website to see if your voter registration information is still available; it may include your voting address.

Other documents--such as old letters, address books, birth certificates, or tax returns--may have your old address. Relatives or friends may remember your old address. If you know the general location, you can use [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) to look for the street address. Finally, you can contact your Local Election Official (contact information [here](/states))--they typically know the area well and may be able to help you if you provide a description.
