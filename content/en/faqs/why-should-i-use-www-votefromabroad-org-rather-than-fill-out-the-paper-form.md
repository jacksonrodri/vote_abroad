We urge voters to use votefromabroad.org to fill out their Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) because: 
The form covers all 50+ US voting jurisdictions, but many states have unique requirements. When you use the website, you can be assured that your form will meet the unique requirements of your state. 

You will be assured all information on your form will be printed out legibly. Illegibility is the major cause of form rejection.

The Instructions will provide the correct address, email, phone and fax information for you to submit your form to your Local Election Official and also to verify that your form has been received.

If you opt to set up a “Voter Account”  you can have the website automatically fill in much of your information when you need to send in the form in subsequent years or if it gets lost and you need to re-send it this year.  If you need to vote a back up/emergency ballot (FWAB), the website will automatically fill in much of the information required on that form as well. (For privacy reasons, your Voter Account will not save your Social Security number).
