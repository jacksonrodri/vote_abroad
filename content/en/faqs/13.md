As a US citizen living abroad, your “voting address” is the street address of the last place you lived in the US. This applies even if your family no longer owns the property, or you no longer have ties to the state, or you don't intend to return to that address or that state, or even if it no longer exists as a residence. It also doesn't matter if you were registered to vote at that address. 

If you are a US citizen who has never lived in the US, your “voting address” is the street address of the last place your US citizen parent lived in the US. If both of your parents are US citizens, you may use the last US address of either one. See also [FAQ #10](/faqs/10) (“**Can I Register To Vote If I’ve Never Resided In The U.S.?**”)
