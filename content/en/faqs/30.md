As a U.S. citizen living abroad, your “voting address” is the address of the last place you lived in the U.S.--regardless of who now owns it, whether you were registered to vote before you left or whether you intend to return to that residence. (See also [FAQ #13](/faqs/13) “**What Should I Use As My ‘Voting Address’?**”) University students may choose to use either your home address or your last address on campus.
