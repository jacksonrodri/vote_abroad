Ass a US citizen living abroad, your “voting address” is the street address of the last place you lived in the US. This applies even if your family no longer owns the property, or you no longer have ties to the state, or you don't intend to return to that address or that state, or even if it no longer exists as a residence. It also doesn't matter if you were registered to vote at that address. (See also [FAQ #13](/faqs/13) “**What Should I Use As My ‘Voting Address’?**”) 

University students may choose to use either your home address or your last address on campus.
