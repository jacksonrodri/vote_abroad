As a US citizen living abroad, your voting address is usually the address of the last place you lived in the US. If you feel you have sufficient ties with another state, you may be eligible to change your voter registration. But it is up to the Local Election Official whether to accept your voter registration in their jurisdiction. You may wish to contact them, explain your situation and ask what their decision will be.
