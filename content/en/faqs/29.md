Yes, you should send in an FPCA. It’s only one page and acts like an address update. But it also provides significant advantages that are only available to overseas voters: 


- An FPCA form, sent in the calendar year of an election, protects your ballot at the federal level in case of a recount. (A ballot that doesn’t have a corresponding FPCA form may be subject to challenge in a close election). 

- You will receive a  ballot for every election in that calendar year, including primaries, special elections and runoff elections. 
- You can use the form to request your ballot be sent to you via email, fax or online instead of postal mail;
- Your state must send out your ballot at least 45 days before the election;
- If you don’t receive your ballot in time to send it in by the deadline, you can use the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) to vote;
- Many states allow overseas voters additional time to submit their ballots and/or allow overseas voters to submit ballots via electronic means.
