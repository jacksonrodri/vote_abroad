Mistakes happen and states can change their procedures, even purging voters from their registration rolls without legitimate cause. During every election period, we hear from voters who found out too late that they won’t be able to vote because they missed the deadline to request their ballot. And a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), sent in the calendar year of an election, protects your ballot at the federal level in case of a recount.
 
If you don’t want to submit a FPCA, please email or call your Local Election Official (contact information here) to verify that you will be receiving a ballot this year. Please also see the answer to FAQ #9 (Why Do I Need To Send In The Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) To Request My Ballot Every Calendar Year?)
