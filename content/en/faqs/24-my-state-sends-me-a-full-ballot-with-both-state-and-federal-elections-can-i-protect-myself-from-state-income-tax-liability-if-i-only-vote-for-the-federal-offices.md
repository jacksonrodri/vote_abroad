Some overseas voters who receive a full ballot (that is, containing both Federal and State races) will only vote the Federal offices as voting for Federal offices as an overseas voter does not change your tax status. However, while we aren’t able to give tax advice, but voting only for Federal offices when you’ve received a full ballot should not make a difference in your state income tax liability. Ballots are secret; no one knows which offices on the ballot you have voted for.

Voting in State and local elections is hugely important! These races decide how your state will apply Federal laws and its own state laws on vital issues like education, health care and the environment. And Governors and state legislators elected in 2018 will control re-districting for both state and federal districts following the 2020 Census.
