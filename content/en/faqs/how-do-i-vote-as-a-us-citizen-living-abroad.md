Here's the process to vote in US elections while living abroad:

1. Register to vote and/or request a ballot: Submit the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) form to your Local Election Official to register to vote--and it will also request a ballot for that calendar year. 

If you are already registered to vote, you still need to submit the FPCA to request your absentee ballot every calendar year.

Be sure to sign the FPCA!

2. Your Local Election Official sends you a blank Absentee Ballot, either by email, fax, website link or postal mail.
3. You fill in the ballot, then submit the voted ballot to your Local Election Official by the deadline.  Depending on the state, you may be able to submit the voted ballot by email or fax, but postal mail is accepted in all states.
