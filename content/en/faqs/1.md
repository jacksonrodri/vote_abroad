**Yes!** US citizens living outside the US have the right to vote in US elections as overseas voters! You must meet the same eligibility requirements as other US voters, such as being 18 years old by the General Election, but it doesn’t matter if you were registered to vote before you left the the US or how long you have lived outside the US.

All overseas voters are eligible to vote in Federal Elections, that is, for President, US Senator and US House of Representatives. Federal elections take place every two (2) years. Overseas voters may vote in the Primary as well as the General election and in any Special federal elections that may be required outside of the regularly scheduled elections.

And every state allows at least some citizens living abroad to vote in state and local elections (for governor, state legislature, mayor, etc.). See also [FAQ #3](/faqs/3) (“**Can I Vote In State And Local Elections?**”)

[VoteFromAbroad](/) (VFA) will assist you in filling out and submitting your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) to your Local Election Official in the U.S. After your FPCA is accepted, you will receive a ballot covering every race in which you are eligible to vote for the remainder of the **calendar year**.
