Your Local Election Official (LEO) must send your blank ballot to you at least 45 days before a scheduled election--or, if the election is fewer than 45 days away, your LEO will send out your blank ballot within a few days after approving your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA).



For the General Election in November, overseas ballots will typically be sent out in the third week of September.
