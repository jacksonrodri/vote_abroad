We aren’t able to provide tax advice, but every US citizen has certain income tax filing obligations, whether they are living in the US or outside the country. Registering to vote does not change your tax status or filing requirements. 

If you are not currently up to date with your US tax obligations, you may wish to talk to your tax advisor about the “streamline filing” program currently run by the IRS. Here’s a link to some IRS websites that may be helpful:
