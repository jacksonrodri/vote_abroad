As a US citizen living abroad, your voting address is usually the address of the last place you lived in the US. This applies no matter how long you've been away or whether or not you ever intend to return to that state.

However, if you feel you have sufficient ties with another state, you may be eligible to register to vote in that location. The strength of your ties to the state will depend on the facts of your situation and typically involve questions like: Do you own property in the state? Do you pay state taxes? Do you stay in the state for lengthy periods of time? How long have you been going to the state? Simply setting up a mailing address in a new state is typically not sufficient to establish ties for voting. 

Please keep in mind, this is general advice about registering to vote as an overseas voter. The Local Election Official in the voting district makes the final determination whether to accept your voter registration in their jurisdiction. You may wish to contact them, explain your situation (contact information [here](/states)) and ask what their decision would be. Or, you can try submitting the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)--which you can produce [here](/)--and see if it is accepted.
