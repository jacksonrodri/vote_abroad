Selecting electronic delivery (Email/Online or Fax) is typically the better option. You’ll get almost instantaneous delivery of your blank ballot--you won’t have to worry that your blank ballot was delayed or lost in the mail. Getting your ballot quickly can make the difference in getting your voted ballot returned by the election deadline. And if you don’t receive your blank ballot when it is due, you’ll know right away to contact your Local Election Official (LEO) to find out what happened. Given the deadlines for voting, the additional time to fix any problems can be crucial.
