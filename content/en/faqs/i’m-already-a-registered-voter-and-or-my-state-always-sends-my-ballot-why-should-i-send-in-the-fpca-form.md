Even though you may vote in a state that typically sends out a ballot without an annual request we still urge all overseas voters to send in their form to request a ballot every year to make sure you will be able to vote. 

But, if you don’t want to send in the form, it’s still very important that you email or call your Local Election official to verify that you will be getting a ballot this year. Mistakes can happen and states can change their voting rules! Every election, we have voters who find out too late that they won’t be able to vote because they missed the deadline to request their ballot.

And remember, an FPCA form, sent in the calendar year of an election, protects your ballot at the federal level in case of a recount.
