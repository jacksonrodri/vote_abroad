If you choose to mail in your ballot--or if your state requires you to do so, here are some suggestions to help you insure your ballot is received by the deadline:

* Request your state send your blank ballot to you by Email/Online or Fax so you’ll get it as soon as it’s ready. (Overseas ballots must go out by 45 days before the election). Remember, this is your blank ballot, so there are no privacy concerns.

* Fill out and return your ballot as soon as you can. Alternatively, if meeting the deadline is a concern, you can have your Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) ready to mail in as soon as ballots are available (that is, 45 days before the election). This is the earliest date you may send in your ballot. For more information about using a FWAB, please see [FAQ #24](/faqs/24) (“**It’s Getting Close To The Election And I Haven’t Received My Blank Ballot Yet; What Should I Do?**”)

* If there is a US Embassy or Consulate available near you, contact them well ahead of time about sending in your ballot using the diplomatic mail pouch. Any US citizen may use this service, you don’t need to have a connection to the Embassy. And the mailing is free if you use the postage-paid mailing template: [www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fwab_envelopeC4.pdf] (https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fwab_envelopeC4.pdf) or [https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fwab_envelope.pdf] (https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fwab_envelope.pdf) Size 10.  
Inquire early! Your Embassy or Consulate may have restrictions as to when it will accept voted ballots and the time lag to the U.S. can be significant. Many Embassies or Consulates will not accept ballots less than a month before an election.

* Check pricing and requirements for express mail services (such as FedEx, DHL, UPS, etc.). This can be expensive, but if regular mail or the diplomatic pouch is not available, it may be the only way you'll be able to get your vote back in time to be counted!
