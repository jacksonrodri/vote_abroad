question: How can I mail in my voted ballot by the deadline?

If you choose to mail in your ballot--or if your state requires you to do so, here are some suggestions to help you insure your ballot is received by the deadline:

* Request your state send your blank ballot to you by Email/Online or Fax so you’ll get it as soon as it’s ready. (Overseas ballots must go out to voters at least 45 days before a federal election). Remember, this is your blank ballot, so there are no ballot secrecy concerns.

* Fill out and return your ballot as soon as you can. Alternatively, if meeting the deadline is a concern, you can send in a Backup Ballot--that is, the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (or FWAB). For more information about using a Backup Ballot, please see [FAQ #24](/faqs/24) (“**It’s Getting Close To The Election And I Haven’t Received My Blank Ballot Yet; What Should I Do?**”)

* If there is a US Embassy or Consulate available near you, contact them well ahead of time about sending in your ballot using the diplomatic mail pouch. Any US citizen may use this service, you don’t need to have a connection to the Embassy. And the mailing is free if you use the US postage-paid mailing template [here](/envelope) 

   Inquire early! Your Embassy or Consulate may have restrictions as to when it will accept voted ballots and the time lag to the U.S. can be significant. Many Embassies or Consulates will not accept ballots less than a month before an election.

* Check pricing and requirements for courier services (such as FedEx, DHL, UPS, etc.). This can be expensive, but if regular mail or the diplomatic pouch is not available, it may be the only way you'll be able to get your vote back in time to be counted!

  And if other voters are sending ballots to the same election office, a single courier envelope may contain multiple sealed ballots.

However you send in your ballot, remember that you (the voter) must be the one who places it in the mail or courier service or gives it to an authorized agent for the US Embassy/Consulate. In some states, it is unlawful for any other person to handle your voted ballot, even if it is sealed.
