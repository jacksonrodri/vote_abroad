We aren’t able to provide tax advice, but every U.S. citizen--regardless where they live--is required to file a federal income tax return to report their worldwide income each year. Registering to vote does not change your tax status or filing requirements. 

If you are not currently up-to-date with your US tax obligations, you may wish to consult a tax professional about the “streamlined filing” program currently run by the IRS. Here’s an [IRS link](http://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/u-s-taxpayers-residing-outside-the-united-states) that may be helpful, and [here’s another](http://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/streamlined-filing-compliance-procedures).
