Yes! All U.S. citizens living outside the U.S. may vote in federal elections for U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives as well as President. See the answer to [FAQ #1](/faqs/1) (“**I Live Outside The U.S., Am I Eligible To Vote In U.S. Elections?**”) 

The midterm elections are federal elections that occur every two years and include all 435 seats in the US House of Representatives along with one-third of the US Senate seats. Your vote is crucial to determine control of Congress!
