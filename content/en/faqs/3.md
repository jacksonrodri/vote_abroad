As noted in the answer to [FAQ #1](/faqs/1) (“**I Live Outside The U.S., Am I Eligible To Vote In U.S. Elections?**”), federal law guarantees the right of U.S. citizens living outside the U.S. to vote in federal elections (President, U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives). But each state determines the right to vote in state and local elections (governor, state legislature, Mayor, etc.) based on the “voter type” you select on your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)

Every state allows overseas voters who indicate they “intend to return” to vote in state and local elections. And more than half of the states (31) also allow overseas voters who indicate their “return is uncertain” to vote in state and local elections. 

VoteFromAbroad (VFA) will assist you in filling out and submitting your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) to your Local Election Official in the U.S. After your FPCA is accepted, you will receive a ballot covering every race in which you are eligible to vote for the remainder of the **calendar year**.
