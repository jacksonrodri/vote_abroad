You should **always** verify with your Local Election Official (LEO) that you will be receiving a ballot. After you send in your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), **call or email** your LEO to verify they received your form and will be sending a blank ballot to you. The contact information is in the Instructions with your completed FPCA as well as on your state's **[State Voting Guide](/states)**

Also, at the bottom of the State Voting Guide page will be a link to your state's website to verify voter status, if one is available, under **[Am I Registered?](/states)** 

Please note that these websites are not always up to date. Also, some states maintain overseas voter registrations separately and the information may not be accessible through the state's website. Be sure to contact your LEO to verify your status even if your name doesn't appear on the website.
