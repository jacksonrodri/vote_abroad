You should always verify with your Local Election Official (LEO) that you will be receiving a ballot. After you send in your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), call or email your LEO to verify they received your form and will be sending a blank ballot to you. The contact information is in the Instructions with your completed FPCA as well as here 

Alternatively, most states provide a website where you can check to verify your voter status, but it is not always up to date. You can find it here (or search for “[state] verify voter registration.”
