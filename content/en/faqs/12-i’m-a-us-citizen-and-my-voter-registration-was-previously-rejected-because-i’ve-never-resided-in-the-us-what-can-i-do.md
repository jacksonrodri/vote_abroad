Most states allow a US citizen who has never resided in the US to register to vote using the address of the last place the US citizen parent lived in the US. 

However, 14 states require that a voter must have actually resided in the state, a position that disenfranchises US citizens like yourself. The US government website to register to vote from abroad (fvap.gov) do not include this option in the form for the 14 states that exclude US citizens who have not resided in their states and votefromabroad.org also excludes this option.

Unfortunately, if you tried to register to vote and indicated you’ve “never resided” in the state, you will likely not be able to register to vote there. If you have a strong tie to another state, such as lengthy (30 days in-state is often a requirement to register to vote) or multiple visits to friends or relatives, you might try to use one of those addresses to register to vote this year.
