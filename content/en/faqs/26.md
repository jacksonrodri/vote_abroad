We aren’t able to provide tax advice, but please be aware that when you fill in your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), selecting “I intend to return” rather than “my return is uncertain” may contribute towards establishing yourself as a tax resident in your voting state. 

Because the legal requirements to establish "residence" or "domicile" for tax purposes are determined by state law and the specific facts of your life, before you note that you "intend to return" on your form you may consider seeking advice on these matters from your tax professional.
