If you successfully submitted a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), your state is required to send out your ballot 45 days before the election. For the November General Elections, ballots are typically sent out by the third week of September. (To verify your FPCA was received and approved, see FAQ #19 (“How Do I Check If I Am Registered To Vote And My Ballot Request Form Was Received So That I’ll Receive An Overseas Ballot?”)
 
If you’re concerned you may not receive your blank ballot in time to return it by the deadline for voted ballots, you can vote using the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB)--also known as the “back-up ballot”. The process for submitting a FWAB can be confusing, so we’ve set up websites with instructions. If your state requires that voted ballots be sent in by Mail, use this site, For states that allow voted ballots to be returned by Email or Fax, use this one 

The FWAB is a ballot--please be sure to follow the instructions carefully! And be aware of the deadline to submit your ballot. The deadline information for your state will be in the Instructions that print out with your completed FWAB.

Finally, if you submit a FWAB and then receive your state’s official ballot, you should complete and return the official ballot as well. If sent and received by your state’s deadlines, your official ballot will be counted instead of the FWAB.
