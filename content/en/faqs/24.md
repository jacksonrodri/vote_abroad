SPECIAL UPDATE FOR THE NOVEMBER 3, 2020 GENERAL ELECTION: 

Due to postal delays in many countries related to the global pandemic, we recommend that voters should submit the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) right away if they vote in states that require ballots to be returned by postal mail. 


There are 22 states that require most overseas voters to return their ballots by mail: 

**Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa** 

**Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,**

 **New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,**

**Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin,** and **Wyoming**

The FWAB is an emergency backup ballot specifically for overseas voters to use to preserve their vote in uncertain circumstances. 
Submitting a FWAB now will preserve your vote in the event that international mail to the US is disrupted during this election.

For detailed instructions how to use a FWAB, please go here: [**www.votefromabroad.org/fwab**](https://www.votefromabroad.org/fwab/)

To check your state's requirements for ballot return, please go here: [**www.votefromabroad.org/states**](https://www.votefromabroad.org/states/)


******

If you successfully submitted a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) to request your ballot, your state is required to send out your ballot 45 days before the election (or within a few days of receiving your FPCA form). For the November General Elections, ballots are typically sent out by the third week of September. 

(To verify your FPCA was received and approved, see [FAQ #19](/faqs/19) (“**How Do I Check If I Am Registered To Vote And My Ballot Request Form Was Received So That I’ll Receive An Overseas Ballot?**”)

_If you requested your blank ballot be sent by email, be sure to check your “spam” folder and any secondary inboxes. You’d be surprised how many ballots are found hiding in there._

If your ballot isn’t in your email folders, contact your Local Election Official right away to find out what happened to it. It’s possible it was lost or that they don’t have you on their voter rolls as an overseas voter. You can look up the contact information [here](/states)

Finally, if you’re concerned you may not receive your blank ballot in time to return it by the deadline for voted ballots, you can vote using the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB)--also known as the “back-up ballot.” For detailed instructions how to use a FWAB, please go here: [**www.votefromabroad.org/fwab**](https://www.votefromabroad.org/fwab/)

The FWAB is a ballot--please be sure to follow the instructions carefully! And be aware of the deadline to submit your ballot. The deadline information for your state will be in the Instructions that print out with your completed FWAB. Please be sure to allow enough time for your FWAB to get back to the US!
