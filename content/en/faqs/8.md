The Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) covers all 50+ U.S. voting jurisdictions but many states have unique requirements. When you use [VFA](/), you can be assured that your FPCA will meet the requirements of your state.

In addition, illegibility is a major reason Local Election Officials reject an FPCA; by using VFA, you will be assured that your FPCA is legible. And using VFA will ensure your FPCA is emailed to the correct office--or, if you send in your form by fax or mail, the instructions will provide the correct contact information.
