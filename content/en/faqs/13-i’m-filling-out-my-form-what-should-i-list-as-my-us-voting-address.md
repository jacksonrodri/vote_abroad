As a US citizen living abroad, your voting address is usually the address of the last place you lived in the US. This applies even if your family no longer owns the property or you no longer have ties to the state or that you don't intend to return to that state. 

If you are a US citizen who has never lived in the US, you use the address of the last place your US citizen parent lived in the US. If both of your parents are US citizens, you may use the last US address of either US parent.
