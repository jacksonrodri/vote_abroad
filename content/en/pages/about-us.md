## About VoteFromAbroad.org

Vote from Abroad has one goal - to make sure every US citizen abroad has the information and tool you need to easily vote from abroad. By using our online tool you are able to generate and send to your local election office in the States a Federal Postcard Application which notifies your local officials that you are abroad and that you'd like to vote in this calendar year. We provide assistance to voters who are US citizens living outside the US, and to members of the military and merchant marines, as well as their families. We help voters request their ballots in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories.
