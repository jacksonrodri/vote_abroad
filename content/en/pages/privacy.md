# **VOTE FROM ABROAD PRIVACY POLICY**

 

(effective September 28, 2018)

 

Vote from Abroad (VFA) is a public service provided by the Democratic Party Committee Abroad, doing business as Democrats Abroad (also known as "DA"). Democrats Abroad—the official Democratic Party organization for millions of Americans living outside the United States—is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. We collect different types of information from you when you use our web-based services ("Services"), as defined further below. This Privacy Policy will help explain what information we collect, how we use it and what options you have in relation to it. To fully understand your rights and obligations related to your use of our online Services, please read our [Terms of Service](https://beta.votefromabroad.org/terms-of-use/).  The key points of our Privacy Policy are provided in the summary below. However, you can also learn more by simply following the links below or by continuing to scroll down.

## **Privacy Policy Summary**

**VFA is a nonpartisan public service.** VFA is a nonpartisan voter registration and overseas ballot request service available to all eligible overseas United States citizens and military voters. Our Services are nonpartisan because we will not withhold or refuse to provide our Services to anyone on the basis of support for or opposition to particular candidates or on the basis of party affiliation. We want you to exercise your right to vote as an American citizen regardless of your party affiliation or lack thereof.  We only ask about your party affiliation (i) to complete your voter registration or ballot request materials ("voter materials") to the extent required by state law, (ii) if you create an online voter account through VFA, in which case we can apply your party affiliation, if any, to future voter materials, or (iii) as a part of an optional survey to better understand the needs and characteristics of overseas voters. **_A fourth situation in which we indirectly ask you about party affiliation is discussed in the fourth paragraph of this Privacy Policy Summary (addressing the “opt-in” feature), as well as in Section 5 (“What happens to my personal data if I “opt-in” to joining Democrats Abroad”), below._**

 

**Our Services.** The VFA site offers a variety of nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote services ("Services") including, but not limited to: (a) state-specific voter registration information (including voter registration, ballot request, and ballot submission deadlines); (b) state-specific voter eligibility requirements as prescribed by law; (&#99;) information on the names and addresses of local election officials (LEOs); (d) state-specific information on the legally accepted means to transmit your voter materials to your LEO; **_(e) access to our voter material preparation tool that allows you to quickly, easily, and accurately prepare your voter materials online and either (1) direct VFA to submit your forms by email to your LEO or (2) print or save your voter materials if your state requires submission by fax or postal mail;_** (f) the ability to create an online voter account that securely stores your voter information and preferences and enables you to prepare voter materials quickly and without the need to re-enter information that has not changed; (g) access to our Voter Help Desk for customer service inquiries to answer questions about overseas voting; and (h) any other services identified in our Terms of Service.

 

**No transfer of your information without consent.** As we provide these Services to you, we want you to know that we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Any information you provide through the VFA website will be handled with the utmost care and with appropriate security measures in place that protect the confidentiality of your personal information. We do not transfer your data to commercial data brokers or to other political entities such as the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), or the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC). **When you grant us permission to do so, we will submit your voter materials to your LEO by email, and we will copy you on the email correspondence using the email address you provide to us.  You consent to this transfer of your personal information by clicking the "SEND EMAIL" button as the final step of our online voter material preparation tool.** **Please note that this transfer only applies to voters in states that permit the submission of applicable voter materials by email. If your state does not permit you to submit your voter materials by email, you will need to save and/or print the forms generated using our online tool and send them to your LEO via postal mail, or by fax if permitted. If you have any questions about this process, please contact the VFA Voter Help Desk at help@votefromabroad.org.**

 

**Understanding the "opt-in" feature.** The VFA website has a feature called the “opt-in”, and we want to be very clear about what that means. The opt-in is a option you can select while using VFA’s voter material preparation tool. The option appears during the process of completing your voter materials whether or not you have a Voter Account, and it allows you to join Democrats Abroad or update and verify your existing membership. You will be asked, “Would you like to join Democrats Abroad?” You may respond “Yes”, “No” or “Already a member”. It is important that you understand you are under no obligation whatsoever to select this option in order to use VFA’s Services, and doing so in no way impacts the Services you are offered when using VFA. **However, if you select “Yes” (to join Democrats Abroad), you are granting your affirmative consent to join Democrats Abroad, in which case you are also consenting to permit the VFA database, which is owned and operated by Democrats Abroad, to transfer your personal data and preferences to the Democrats Abroad membership database.** For more information on the “opt-in”, see the Section 5 below.

 

**Use of your information.** Unless you opt-in to membership in Democrats Abroad (in which case, see Section 5), we will not use any information provided to us here for any purpose other than in connection with the preparation and submission of your voter materials, the maintenance of your voter account, or to ensure our database is functioning properly. Also, we use aggregate information about our users for statistical reports, but it will not be possible to identify you from such reports. We use those reports to determine the number of VFA users, where they reside, where they vote, etc. We will not disclose your information to third parties for any other purpose unless we first obtain your consent, except as required by applicable law or regulation.

 

**How your information is stored and shared**. Any information that you provide through the VFA website will be collected and transferred to a database stored on a secure server maintained by Democrats Abroad in the United States of America. **_Thus, if you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States; by using our website and giving us your information, you consent to such transfer._**   When you provide information using the VFA voter material preparation tool but without creating a Voter Account, your information will automatically be deleted ninety (90) days after the date of the next federal United States general election.  If you choose to create a Voter Account, any information you provide while logged into your account will be stored permanently so that we can service your account.  See Sections 6 and 7 for more information on data storage and retention and on how to permanently delete your Voter Account.

As a portion of our users reside in the European Union (EU), this privacy policy and our online practices designed to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are committed to providing you with a very high level of privacy protection, and this privacy policy is the same for all visitors and users of our website, regardless of where they reside. You should be aware, however, that applicable laws and regulations protecting personal information in the United States may not offer identical protection as provided in other jurisdictions, including those that belong to the European Economic Area.

## **4. When we share information**

We do not sell, or otherwise share, the information we collect about you to commercial data brokers or anyone else (subject to the necessary security, contractual and transfer safeguards). We do not provide your data to other political entities such as the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), or the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC). However, there are some very limited exceptions in which we provide access to your personal information to certain individuals or organizations, as follows:

 **·      When you grant us permission to do so, we will submit your voter materials to your LEO by email, and we will copy you on the email correspondence using the email address you provide to us.  You consent to this transfer of your personal information by clicking the "SEND EMAIL" button as the final step of our online voter material preparation tool. ** **Please note that this transfer only applies to voters in states that permit the submission of applicable voter materials by email. If your state does not permit you to submit your voter materials by email, you will need to save and/or print the forms generated using our online tool and send them to your LEO via postal mail, or by fax if permitted. If you have any questions about this process, please contact the VFA Voter Help Desk at help@votefromabroad.org.**

·     Executive officers and information technology professionals of Democrats Abroad.  VFA is directly owned and operated by Democrats Abroad. Accordingly, executive officers and selected IT professionals have access to information collected and processed through VFA. These individuals are all subject to confidentiality agreements.

·     As explained in the Privacy Policy Summary and in Section 5 below, personal information collected by VFA is only transferred to the Democrats Abroad membership database if the user affirmatively opts-in to joining Democrats Abroad by clicking the appropriate box during VFA’s voter registration / ballot request application process. These "opt-in" members are subject to the Democrats Abroad Privacy Policy, available at:[ https://www.democratsabroad.org/privacy](https://www.democratsabroad.org/privacy)

·    We may use or share the information that you provide if we are under a duty to disclose your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation; or to enforce the relevant terms of service and any other agreement; or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations such as credit agencies, law enforcement or government bodies or the courts in connection with a criminal investigation, suspected illegal activity, fraud prevention and detection, or in legal proceedings.

We do not control information which is sent from your browser to third parties, including social media platforms, analytics companies and advertising networks that receive information in the normal course of your online activities.

Personal information may be transferred to, or routed through servers in, other countries where Democrats Abroad or its service providers maintain operations. These countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to the country from where you access the Services or, in the case of transfers subject to European law, may not be subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission (EC).   An adequacy decision is a decision taken by the EC establishing that a third country provides a comparable level of protection of personal data to that in the EU, through its domestic law or its international commitments.

If it becomes necessary for Democrats Abroad to transfer your personal information to a third party, it will seek to take account of any applicable legal obligations relevant to personal information transfers.  In the case of transfers of personal information out of the European Economic Area, it will, in the absence of an EC adequacy decision relevant to the destination country, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as a valid Privacy Shield certification (in the case of a data transfer to a Privacy Shield certified US recipient - [ https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome)) or enter into appropriate EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to personal data transfers between data controllers or between a data controller and a data processor: ([http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm)).

## **5. What happens to my personal data if I "opt-in" to joining Democrats Abroad**

*Joining Democrats Abroad Using the "Opt-in" Feature.* The VFA website has a feature called the “opt-in”, and we want to be very clear about what that means. The opt-in is a option you can select while using VFA’s voter material preparation tool (see the image below). The option appears during the process of completing your voter materials whether or not you have a Voter Account, and it allows you to join Democrats Abroad or update and verify your existing membership. You will be asked, “Would you like to join Democrats Abroad?” You may respond “Yes”, “No” or “Already a member”. It is important that you understand you are under no obligation whatsoever to select this option in order to use VFA’s Services, and doing so in no way impacts the Services you are offered when using VFA.  **However, if you select “Yes” (to join Democrats Abroad), you are granting your affirmative consent to join Democrats Abroad, in which case you are also consenting to permit the VFA database, which is owned and operated by Democrats Abroad, to transfer your personal data and preferences to the Democrats Abroad membership database.**

(i)                Privacy Policy ([https://www.democratsabroad.org/privacy](https://www.democratsabroad.org/privacy));

## **6. Security, storage and data retention**

**Security.** Your privacy is important to us and we place great importance on the steps we take, including technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. You are responsible for keeping your verification code and other login credentials confidential (we use two-step verification). We advise you not to share your credentials with anyone. We will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions entered into using your login credentials.

**Storage.** Any information that you provide through the VFA website will be collected and transferred to a database stored on a secure server maintained by Democrats Abroad in the United States of America. In other words, when you input data into VFA, you authorize your data to be directly saved to a server in the United States of America. This information is collected and stored by Democrats Abroad. Voter-Account-based data is stored on the U.S.-based server in order to enable the operation of the user’s Voter Account. **_Thus, if you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States; by using our website and giving us your information, you consent to such transfer._** When you provide information using the VFA voter material preparation tool but without creating a Voter Account, your information will automatically be deleted within ninety (90) days following the next federal United States general election, unless we have identified or are informed of a legal reason to maintain your information (in which case we will delete your information within a reasonable time after the aforementioned legal reasons no longer exist).  If you choose to create a Voter Account, any information you provide while logged into your account will be stored permanently so that we can service your account.    


**Retention.** Data retention will differ according to the way you choose to use our Services.

(a)     *Browsing*: Except for the collection of technical and device information (see Sections 2(&#99;) and 3(&#99;), above) and the preparation of voter materials, all users of the VFA website can browse and use our Services without creating an account, logging into an account, or entering personally identifiable information into the VFA database.

(b)    *Preparation of Voter Material without a Voter Account*: You can use our Services to prepare voter material without establishing a Voter Account. If you choose this option, your information will not be permanently stored on our server, as it will be automatically deleted within ninety (90) days following the next federal United States general election, which is routinely scheduled for the Tuesday following the first Monday in November in even numbered years. This information will be retained for the purposes of (1) responding to any customer service inquiries lodged during the election cycle, (2) determining whether the bridge between the VFA database and the Democrats Abroad database is functioning properly, and (3) preserving records connected with voter material for a reasonable time after any election challenge may be filed.  Following the "Election plus 90" retention period, all records subject to this paragraph will be permanently deleted, unless prohibited by law, court order, legal right or obligation, etc.

(c )    *Creating a Voter Account*: If you choose to create a Voter Account, the personal information in the account will be stored for your future use. The purpose of the Voter Account service is to streamline the search for relevant public election information and speed repetitive tasks. Please note that the creation of a Voter Account is purely optional. Visitors to the VFA site can have access to the full complement of information on the site without a Voter Account. As long as you keep your Voter Account, we retain the personal information you have chosen to share with us. This is done in order to provide you the Services that the account offers.

**If you would like to permanently delete your VFA voter account, please contact the Help Desk at [help@votefromabroad.org](mailto:helpdesk@votefromabroad.org)**. (In the future, we hope to offer a user-controlled data removal solution that would enable each user to delete his or her Voter Account by logging in and clicking a remove account button.) You can contact us directly with requests to correct, erase, restrict, or move, or to object to, your personal information. If you do not want us to process and/or access your personal information, you may be unable to use some of our Services.

## **8. Children’s information**

United States citizens must be over the age of 18 to be eligible to vote. This means that most people who use the VFA website to register to vote are over the age of 18.   However, any United States citizen may register to vote if he or she will be 18 or older on the date of the next federal election. Because federal elections occur every two years, it is possible for a 16-year-old to complete and submit voter registration forms to their local election officials; thus, it is possible that we may collect information on individuals who are 16 years old. 

**However, we strongly recommend that younger voters wait to register to vote until January of the year in which they will turn 18, provided that the voter’s 18th birthday is on or before the date of the November general election**. **Because voter registration laws vary from state to state, we encourage all eligible voters, regardless of age, to submit their voter registration and/or ballot request applications as soon as possible in January of each calendar year.** 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Democrats Abroad. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information or non-personally identifiable information from users under 16 years of age, other than as permitted by law in support of our internal operations.[ ](http://www.sega.co.uk/Privacy?mc_cid=21c0fd1138&mc_eid=2854b5e2af#_Children%E2%80%99s_information)If we learn that personal information of users under the age of 16 has been collected, Democrats Abroad will take reasonable steps to remove such information. If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected personal information about your child who is under 16 years of age, you may contact us using the details provided below.
