Request your ballot in time to vote.

If you're over 18 and are a US citizen, you can vote in the location where you last resided before moving abroad. (Even if that was 40 years ago!) 

In order to make sure you receive a ballot, you need to request it from the local election office in the zip code where you last lived using a federal request form. **Votefromabroad** walks you through filling in that form and sending it in to your election office.[](https://www.votefromabroad.org/request/your-information/)

Remember - Americans abroad need to request your ballot every calendar year you'd like to vote!
