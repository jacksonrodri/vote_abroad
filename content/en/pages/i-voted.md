**Request your ballot in time to vote.**

If you're 18 or over by Nov. 3, and are a US citizen, you can vote in the location where you last resided before moving abroad. (Even if that was 40 years ago!) 

In order to make sure you receive a ballot, you need to request it from the local election office in the zip code where you last lived using a federal request form. **Votefromabroad** walks you through filling in that form and sending it in to your election office.

*Remember - Americans abroad need to request our ballot every calendar year we'd like to vote!*
