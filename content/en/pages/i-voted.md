### Americans abroad - time is running out to request your ballot in time to vote. \

If you're over 18 and are a US citizen, you can vote in the location where you last resided before moving abroad. (Even if that was 40 years ago!) 

In order to make sure you receive a ballot, you have to request it from your local election office in the US using a federal request form. **Votefromabroad** helps you fill in that form for your state, sign it, and send it in to your election office.

Remember to request your ballot every calendar year you'd like to vote!
