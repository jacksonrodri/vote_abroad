## **VOTE FROM ABROAD COOKIE POLICY**

The Democratic Party Committee Abroad, doing business as Democrats Abroad, ("we", “us” and “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies to distinguish you from other users on our VoteFromAbroad.org website (VFA or the VFA website). This helps us to provide you with a better experience when you access the VFA website. This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, our Vote From Abroad Privacy Policy will apply to our processing of the data that we collect via cookies.

 

**_What are cookies?_**

Cookies are small data files of text that are downloaded onto your PC, phone or other device when you visit the VFA website. Cookies generally contain a site name and a unique user ID. Once the cookie is on your device, the VFA website "knows" that you have been there before and can then use that knowledge to tailor the experience that you have.

 

**_Why do we use cookies?_**

Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a website to allow a visitor to, for example, remember the user's preferences or registration details for a future visit. Among other things, cookies help us improve our sites and your experience. We may also use cookies and other technologies to provide you with personalized messaging like saving your name and email address when you use the help desk chat. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser's help section to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features on our website.

 

**_Different types of cookies_**

The different types of cookies that we may use on the VFA website fall into the categories described below. These descriptions can help you determine if and how you would like to interact with our Websites:

**_(a) Required cookies_**

Required cookies enable basic site functionality and follow your progress through the Website. These essential cookies have to be enabled in order for you to browse our Websites and move between pages. We are unable to identify you personally by using these types of cookies.

**_(b) Anonymous visitor statistics cookies_**

We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our Websites, what type of operating system is being used (e.g. Mac or Windows) so that we can identify when our Website isn't working as it should, how long you spend on the site, what pages are viewed etc. This helps us to continuously improve our Websites. These "analytics" cookies also provide anonymous information about how you reached the site.

**_(c) Social networking and third-party function cookies_**

The VFA website interacts with social networking websites so that you can easily "Like" or share our content on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GooglePlus, Pintrest, etc. You should refer to the privacy policies of these social networking websites to understand how they use your personal information.

**_(d) Site improvement cookies_**

From time to time, we may test new designs or website features on the VFA website. We may do this by showing slightly different versions of our website to different people and anonymously monitoring how our site visitors respond to these different versions. Ultimately this helps us to offer you a better website.

**_(e) Advertising and remarketing cookies_**

Cookies are used widely for online advertising. Neither we or our advertising partners can obtain data that can personally identify you from these cookies. We only work with advertising partners who work to accepted privacy standards. You may notice that sometimes after visiting our Websites or other websites, that you see increased numbers of advertisements from the site you visited. This is because advertisers, including ourselves, pay for these advertisements, which are known as "remarketing cookies" during your visit. We use these advertisements to tailor offers that encourage you to come back to our Website.

**_Turning cookies off_**

**_You can change how cookies are stored on your machine by clicking on the "Tools" menu in your internet browser for your device.
