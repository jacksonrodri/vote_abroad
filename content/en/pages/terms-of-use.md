**TERMS OF SERVICE**

Last updated September 28, 2018. Replaces all prior versions.

**IMPORTANT – READ CAREFULLY:** **THESE TERMS OF SERVICE APPLY TO ALL USES OF THE VFA WEBSITE, INCLUDING BROWSING, REGISTERING A VOTER ACCOUNT, AND USING VFA SERVICES ANONYMOUSLY WITHOUT REGISTERING A VOTER ACCOUNT.**

The services offered through the Vote From Abroad **("VFA")** website are provided to you by the Democratic Party Committee Abroad (referred to herein as “Democrats Abroad” or “we”), doing business as Democrats Abroad, a non-profit political committee organized under the laws of the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), United States of America and registered with the Federal Election Commission. Democrats Abroad is the official Democratic Party organization for millions of Americans living outside the United States. 

**_What is Vote From Abroad?_****  **VFA is a **nonpartisan voter registration and overseas ballot request service** available to all overseas United States citizens and military voters. Our services are nonpartisan because we will not withhold or refuse to provide our services to anyone on the basis of support for or opposition to particular candidates or on the basis of party affiliation. We want you to exercise your right to vote as an American citizen regardless of your party affiliation or lack thereof. 

As defined in Section 1 below, our services are offered subject to your compliance with all of the terms and conditions contained herein **(the "Agreement")** and all other agreements including the [VFA Privacy Policy](https://beta.votefromabroad.org/privacy/) and Cookie Policy. The services you can access may vary depending on whether you have registered for a voter account through VFA **(“Voter Account”).** However, some features of the services may still be available to you if you decide not to register for an account (See Section 3, below).

**Please note:** In exchange for our permission to use VFA services free of charge, this Agreement contains important limitations on your legal rights. These limitations are material conditions of this Agreement, and if you do not agree to be bound by them, you may not, and you should not, use VFA services **("Services").**  By way of example and without limitation, these conditions include: 

1. You agree that VFA may send you emails related to your use of our Services **_(Secs. 3.8, 4.10)_**

2. Use restrictions for children under the age of 18 **(****_Sec. 6_****);** 

3. Restrictions on your conduct and your expectation of privacy when you use the Services **(****_Secs. 8, 9_****);** 

4. Your agreement to indemnify Democrats Abroad for harm you cause **(****_Sec. 15_****);** 

5. Your consent to our collection, processing, storing and deletion of your personally identifiable information based on the way you choose to use the Services **(****_Secs. 1-7, 19; VFA Privacy Policy; VFA Cookie Policy_****);**

6. Limitation of our liability for any damages you incur while using the Services **(****_Sec. 20_****);**

7. Waiver of your right to file or join a class action claim against Democrats Abroad **(****_Sec. 20.5_****);**

8. *Re-permissioning communications: *When we amend our Terms of Service, the VFA Privacy Policy, or the VFA Cookie Policy, you consent to receiving "re-permissioning" communications from us. In other words, we may contact you by email to inform you of the amendment and seek your affirmative consent to the amended terms **(****_Sec. 21.7_****);** 

9. Your agreement to apply the laws of Washington D.C. (United States of America) to this Agreement and to submit to the **_exclusive jurisdiction and venue_**** **of courts located in Washington D.C. **(****_Sec. 21.8_****).**


**Questions.** If you have any questions about this Agreement, please send an email to: [help@votefromabroad.org](mailto:help@votefromabroad.org). You may also contact us directly by U.S. mail at Democrats Abroad, PO Box 15130, Washington, DC 20003, USA. 

**1.  	Description of Services; Acceptance of Binding Agreement **

1.1	To access and use VFA Services (as defined below), you must agree to, and follow, the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Service. By registering an account through the VFA website or using any of VFA’s Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please carefully read through this Agreement. 

 

1.2	*VFA Services*. The VFA site offers a variety of nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote services including, but not limited to: (a) state-specific voter registration information (including voter registration, ballot request, and ballot submission deadlines); (b) state-specific voter eligibility requirements as prescribed by law; (c) information on the names and addresses of local election officials (LEOs); (d) state-specific information on the legally accepted means to transmit your voter materials to your LEO; **_(e) access to our voter material preparation tool that allows you to quickly, easily, and accurately prepare your voter materials online and either (1) direct VFA to submit your forms by email to your LEO or (2) print or save your voter materials if your state requires submission by fax or postal mail;_*** * (f) the ability to create an online voter account that securely stores your voter information and preferences and enables you to prepare voter materials quickly and without the need to re-enter information that has not changed; (g) access to our Voter Help Desk for customer service inquiries or to answer questions about overseas voting; and (h) any other services identified in this Agreement or offered on the VFA website.  

1.3	*No Fee for Services.* All VFA Services are offered to you free of charge. However, we and you agree to exchange certain promises, as set forth in this Agreement, to do (or refrain from doing) certain activities that we and you are not otherwise legally obligated to do (or refrain from doing). You also agree to limit (or in some cases, give up) certain rights that you have in exchange for our permission to use VFA Services.  Therefore, even though you do not pay any money to use our Services, this Agreement is still a binding legal contract based upon the mutual representations, promises, and limitations contained herein.

1.4	*Using VFA Services. *In principle, there are three ways that you can use VFA Services: (a) browsing the VFA website; (b) registering a Voter Account to prepare voter materials; and (c) using the VFA website to prepare voter materials anonymously without registering a Voter Account. Unless stated otherwise in this Agreement, these Terms of Service apply generally to any and all uses of VFA Services.  For example, under Sections 12 and 13, you acknowledge that you have no rights, and claim no rights, to Democrats Abroad’s copyright or intellectual property, and this applies whether or not you are browsing the VFA website, using a registered Voter Account, preparing voter materials anonymously using our online tool, etc. 

1. *Browsing.* When you browse our public website, you consent to our collection of personal information as stated in these Terms of Service, the VFA Privacy Policy, and the VFA Cookie Policy as they apply to browsing (See Section 2, below).

2. *No Voter Account (An**onymous use)**.* When you use our online voter material preparation tool without creating a Voter Account, you consent to these Terms of Service, the VFA Privacy Policy, and the VFA Cookie Policy as they apply to browsing and accessing non-Voter-Account-based Services (See Section 3, below).

3. *Voter Account. *When you create a voter account through the VFA website, you consent to these Terms of Service, the VFA Privacy Policy, and the VFA Cookie Policy as they apply to browsing and accessing our Voter-Account-based Services (See Sections 4-7, below).

1.5	*Data privacy. *While the terms of this Agreement generally apply to all uses of VFA Services, your data privacy is impacted by the way you choose to use our Services.  For example, we collect the least amount of your information if you simply browse the VFA website, while we collect the greatest amount of your information (and retain it until you instruct us to delete your account) if you register a Voter Account. For detailed information on how we collect, use and store your data, please see Sections 2-7, 16, and 19, below, the VFA Privacy Policy, and the VFA Cookie Policy.

**2.  	Browsing the VFA Website**

2.1	*Technical and device information*. When you browse the VFA website, you consent to our collection of technical information from your mobile or computer device, for example, your location information, which devices are connected to the Internet, hardware settings, components of your devices, installed software, updates and plugins to facilitate the use of our Services. We may automatically collect information such as your operating system, Internet Protocol address, your browser type, browser language preferences and when, how often and how long you interact with our Services. We and/or third party services use cookies and similar technologies. See also our [Cookie Policy](http://www.sega.co.uk/cookiepolicy).

2.2 	*Browsing Activity and Feedback. *We collect information from your web-browsing activity about the way you use our Services. We may also collect information about you from the notifications or messages you post on our website or send us online as well as what you search for, look at and engage with. Information obtained from social features, if any, used in connection with our online Services, such as forums and chat functionality, may be stored, copied or used by Democrats Abroad, the public, or third-party companies. We will collect personal information from the messages and reviews you post on our social forums, if any, and when you contact our helpdesk at [help@votefromabroad.org](mailto:help@votefromabroad.org), for example, with a question, problem or comment. If you contact our customer service team by email or post, we will keep copies of your correspondence with us to deal with your query and to preserve our legal rights, claims or defenses. 

2.3	You agree that the terms of this Section 2 shall apply whenever you access the VFA website, regardless of the category of VFA Services you are using. 

**3. 	Using VFA Services without registering a Voter Account**

**3.1   **    	**_Starting an anonymous session. _****If you do not want to create a Voter Account, you must click the link "or start an anonymous session" on the VFA home page.  This link appears below the “START” button. Do not enter your phone number or email address as prompted on the home page.**

*3.2	**Technical and device information. *Some features of the Services provided by VFA will be available to you even if you decide not to register an Account, in which case Democrats Abroad will store limited non-personally identifiable information (including but not limited to device identification information and IP address) for the purpose of enabling you to use those Services (See Section 2, above). 

3.3	*Accurate information. *You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information when using the voter material preparation tool without registering a Voter Account. Democrats Abroad reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided proves to be materially false or inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You agree to immediately notify Democrats Abroad of any unauthorized use of your Account.

**3.****4****       	****_Authorization to submit your voter materials by email through VFA. _** **When you grant us permission to do so, we will submit your voter materials to your LEO by email, and we will copy you on the email correspondence using the email address you provide to us.  You consent to this transfer of your personal information by clicking the "SEND EMAIL" button as the final step of our online voter material preparation tool. ** **Please note that this transfer only applies to voters in states that permit the submission of applicable voter materials by email. If your state does not permit you to submit your voter materials by email, you will need to save and/or print the forms generated using our online tool and send them to your LEO via postal mail, or by fax if permitted. If you have any questions about this process, please contact the VFA Voter Help Desk at help@votefromabroad.org.**

3.5	*Personally identifiable information. *When you use our Services to register to vote or request your ballot without creating a Voter Account, you consent to our collection of information about you necessary for completing your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) or Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) forms. This information includes your full name, gender, status as a citizen of the United States of America, information on whether you are residing overseas temporarily, indefinitely, etc., email address, telephone number, date of birth, residential address abroad, voting address in the United States, personal preferences, and additional information that you choose to provide. We may also ask for your consent to receive communications from VFA in connection with VFA’s Services.  

**3.****6****	****_Data retention and deletion._*** *Any information that you provide through the VFA website will be collected and transferred to a database stored on a secure server maintained by Democrats Abroad in the United States of America. **_Thus, if you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States; by using our website and giving us your information, you consent to such transfer._**  When you provide information using the VFA voter material preparation tool, your information will automatically be deleted ninety (90) days after the date of the next federal United States general election.  If you choose to create a Voter Account, any information you provide while logged into your account will be stored permanently so that we can service your account.  See Sections 6 and 7 of the VFA Privacy Policy for more information on data storage and retention and on how to permanently delete your Voter Account.  We delete this information in order to protect the privacy of users who do not wish to establish a Voter Account with us.  However, we do retain that information for the above-stated period for the purposes of (1) responding to any customer service inquiries, (2) determining whether the bridge between our Licensor’s database and the Democrats Abroad database is functioning properly, (3) fixing or responding to database or user-submission errors; (4) generating anonymized, aggregated statistical reports; (5) preserving our legal rights, claims, and defenses; and (6) preserving records of use and voter material submissions in order to respond to inquiries from election authorities, election challenges, etc.  

 

3.7	*Sensitive personal information. *Some states require voters to provide sensitive personal information when registering to vote or requesting an absentee ballot. Sensitive personal information includes information such as driver’s license numbers, Social Security Numbers or the last four digits thereof, political party affiliation information, an electronic image of your signature, etc. Even if you provide this information while using our services, we do not store this information and have no access to this information through our VFA database. For privacy and security purposes, unique web links provided to download completed forms expire shortly after they are created, and, except for our copy of the email you authorize to be sent to your LEO through the VFA website, neither the links nor any other copy of your completed forms are stored or otherwise retained by Democrats Abroad.

  

3.8	*Use of information. *The information you give us during your anonymous session may be used by Democrats Abroad in connection with your use of our Services. In particular, we will send electronic messages to confirm the submission of your voter materials or to remind you to submit your voter materials to your LEO, and we may also send electronic messages about associated Services, to the email address you provide us. Your information will be held in accordance with the VFA Privacy Policy (see Privacy Policy Sections 3 and 6 for more details on use and retention).

*3.9	**Third party and social media platforms. *Please note that we do not control the information that is sent from your browser to third parties, including social media platforms, analytics companies and advertising networks which receive information in the normal course of your online activities. 

3.10	*Joining Democrats Abroad Using the "Opt-in" **Feature**. *The VFA website has a feature called the “opt-in”, and we want to be very clear about what that means. The opt-in is a option you can select while using VFA’s voter material preparation tool. The option appears during the process of completing your voter materials whether or not you have a Voter Account, and it allows you to join Democrats Abroad or update and verify your existing membership. You will be asked, “Would you like to join Democrats Abroad?” You may respond “Yes”, “No” or “Already a member”. It is important that you understand you are under no obligation whatsoever to select this option in order to use VFA’s Services, and doing so in no way impacts the Services you are offered when using VFA.*  ***However,** **if you ****select “Yes” (to join Democrats Abroad)****, you are granting your affirmative consent to join Democrats Abroad, in which case you are also consenting to permit the VFA database, which is owned and operated by Democrats Abroad, to transfer your personal data and preferences to the Democrats Abroad membership database. **For more information on the “opt-in”, see the VFA Privacy Policy, Section 5.

**4. 	Registering a Voter Account**

4.1	*Purpose and Voter Account Creation. *You may register a Voter Account through the VFA website to securely store your voter information and preferences. This will enable you to prepare voter materials faster by eliminating the need to re-enter your voter information and preferences. Your Voter Account will be created based on the information you enter into the VFA website, beginning with the entry of your phone number or email address on the VFA home page. **If you do not want to create a Voter Account, you must click the link "or start an anonymous session".**

4.2	*Technical and device information. *Democrats Abroad will store limited non-personally identifiable information (including but not limited to device identification information and IP address) for the purpose of enabling you to use those Services (See Section 2, above).

4.3	*Accurate information. *You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Democrats Abroad reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be materially false or inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You agree to immediately notify Democrats Abroad of any unauthorized use of your Account.

**4.4       	****_Authorization to submit your voter materials by email through VFA. _** **When you grant us permission to do so, we will submit your voter materials to your LEO by email, and we will copy you on the email correspondence using the email address you provide to us.  You consent to this transfer of your personal information by clicking the "SEND EMAIL" button as the final step of our online voter material preparation tool. ** **Please note that this transfer only applies to voters in states that permit the submission of applicable voter materials by email. If your state does not permit you to submit your voter materials by email, you will need to save and/or print the forms generated using our online tool and send them to your LEO via postal mail, or by fax if permitted. If you have any questions about this process, please contact the VFA Voter Help Desk at ****[help@votefromabroad.or**g](mailto:help@votefromabroad.org)**.**

4.5 	*Personally identifiable information. *When you use our Services to register to vote or request your ballot by creating a Voter Account, you consent to our collection of information about you necessary for completing your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) or Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) forms. This information includes your full name, gender, status as a citizen of the United States of America, information on whether you are residing overseas temporarily, indefinitely, etc., email address, telephone number, date of birth, residential address abroad, voting address in the United States, personal preferences, and additional information that you choose to provide. We may also ask for your consent to receive certain communications from VFA in connection with VFA’s Services.  

4.6	*Data retention and deletion. *If you choose to create a Voter Account, the personal information in the account will be stored for your future use. The purpose of the Voter Account service is to streamline the search for relevant public election information and speed repetitive tasks. Please note that the creation of a Voter Account is purely optional. Visitors to the VFA site can have access to the full complement of information on the site without a Voter Account. As long as you keep your Voter Account, we retain the personal information you have chosen to share with us. This is done in order to provide you the Services that the account offers. Even if you only use your Voter Account to generate forms for certain elections, we maintain the account until you instruct us to remove it. **To delete your account, please email email our Help Desk at help@votefromabroad.org.**

  

4.7	*Sensitive personal information. *Some states require voters to provide sensitive personal information when registering to vote or requesting an absentee ballot. Sensitive personal information includes information such as driver’s license numbers, Social Security Numbers or the last four digits thereof, political party affiliation information, an electronic image of your signature, etc. Even if you provide this information while using our services, we do not store this information and have no access to this information through our VFA database. For privacy and security purposes, unique web links provided to download completed forms expire shortly after they are created, and, except for our copy of the email you authorize to be sent to your LEO through the VFA website, neither the links nor any other copy of your completed forms are stored or otherwise retained by Democrats Abroad.

4.8	*Login and passwords. *VFA uses two-step verification to allow you to create and use your Voter Account securely. Accordingly, no password is required to use VFA Services, including the online voter material preparation tool.  In the event that any new services are offered by VFA requiring a password, you agree to create your own account with a strong password, which is different from any password you use for your other online services. The system may remember your sign-in information depending on your browser and client settings and whether you select the option to store these settings, which means that you will be automatically signed into your password-protected account for some or all of the Services which are available to you. If any VFA Services are accessed using a password, you will be able to reset your password at any time by clicking on a "Forgot Password" button on the applicable account login screen. The password will be sent to the email address registered with your account. You are responsible for safeguarding your password.

4.9       	*Confidentiality of login credentials. *You must keep your Voter Account and other accounts with VFA secure and keep your account details confidential. You agree that you will not disclose your password or verification code to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Voter Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions.

4.10      	*Use of information. *The information you give us during your registration may be used by Democrats Abroad in connection with your use of our Services and the operation of your Voter Account. In particular, we will send electronic messages to provide you with your verification code for login purposes, to confirm the submission of your voter materials, and/or to remind you to submit your voter materials to your LEO, and we may also send electronic messages about the features of Services which are available to you as a result of registering and maintaining your Voter Account, as well as information about associated Services, to the email address you register. Your information will be held in accordance with the VFA Privacy Policy (see Privacy Policy Sections 3 and 6 for more details on use and retention).

4.11      	*Multiple Accounts. *You may register multiple Voter Accounts, provided that you register a different email address or telephone number for each Voter Account. We do not combine information from one Voter Account with information from another Voter Account, unless we suspect that there has been a breach of the general prohibitions in Section 8 of this Agreement, in which case all Voter Accounts you have registered may be temporarily or permanently disabled.

4.12	*Joining Democrats Abroad Using the "Opt-in" Feature. *The VFA website has a feature called the “opt-in”, and we want to be very clear about what that means. The opt-in is a option you can select while using VFA’s voter material preparation tool. The option appears during the process of completing your voter materials whether or not you have a Voter Account, and it allows you to join Democrats Abroad or update and verify your existing membership. You will be asked, “Would you like to join Democrats Abroad?” You may respond “Yes”, “No” or “Already a member”. It is important that you understand you are under no obligation whatsoever to select this option check that box in order to use VFA’s Services, and doing so in no way impacts the Services you are offered when using VFA.*  ***However,** **if you select “Yes” (to join Democrats Abroad), you are granting your affirmative consent to join Democrats Abroad, in which case you are also consenting to permit the VFA database, which is owned and operated by Democrats Abroad, to transfer your personal data and preferences to the Democrats Abroad membership database. **For more information on the “opt-in”, see the VFA Privacy Policy, Section 5.

 

**5. 	Registering for an Account using Social Networking Services**

5.1       	We may allow you to register for your Account using certain third-party social media or social networking services ("**SNS**") including, but not limited to Facebook. If you decide to register through an SNS, we may extract the personal information you have provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) from the account you have with the applicable SNS and use that information to create your Account. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. You hereby consent to our access to and collection of such personal information about you.

5.2       	If you register a Voter Account using a social networking account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information to your SNS and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete.

5.3	*Third party and social media platforms. *Please note that we do not control the information that is sent from your browser to third parties, including social media platforms, analytics companies and advertising networks which receive information in the normal course of your online activities. 

 

**6. 	Account registration and use of Services by Children**

6.1       	Local laws in your respective jurisdiction may require that you are of a certain age in order to agree to the terms of this Agreement, which is a requisite for registering for an Account. For example, individuals residing in the Washington D.C., and most jurisdictions within the United States, must be at least 18 years old to enter into certain legally binding arrangements.

6.2     	In the event that you are under the required age, you may not continue to register a Voter Account and/or use the Services, unless your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms. Local laws may also require that children under a certain age are supervised during their use of the Services and/or before any personal data is collected by the VFA website. By using the Services, you warrant that you are old enough to use the Services without supervision. If you are under the required age, your parent or legal guardian warrants that they are supervising and monitoring your use of the Services at all times, including to ensure that you do not upload or share any personal information without first obtaining their consent.

6.3	In principle, United States citizens eligible to vote must be over the age of 18. This means that most people who use the VFA website to register to vote are over the age of 18.   However, any United States citizen may register to vote if he or she will be 18 or older on the date of the next federal election. Because federal elections occur every two years, it is possible for a 16-year-old to complete and submit voter registration forms to their local election officials; thus, it is possible that we may collect information on individuals who are 16 years old.   **However, we strongly recommend that younger voters wait to register to vote until January of the year in which they will turn 18, provided that the voter’s 18th birthday is on or before the date of the November general election**. **Because voter registration laws vary from state to state, we encourage all eligible voters, regardless of age, to submit their voter registration and/or ballot request applications as soon as possible in January of each calendar year.**   

 

6.4	Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Democrats Abroad. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information or non-personally identifiable information from users under 16 years of age, other than as permitted by law in support of our internal operations. If we learn that personal information of users under the age of 16 has been collected, Democrats Abroad will take reasonable steps to remove such information. If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected personal information about your child who is under 16 years of age, you may contact us using the details provided below.

**7. 	Closing your Account**

**7.1**       	**If you would like to permanently delete your VFA voter account, please contact the Help Desk at ****[help@votefromabroad.or**g](mailto:helpdesk@votefromabroad.org)**. ** (In the future, we hope to offer a user-controlled data removal solution that would enable each user to delete his or her Voter Account by logging in and clicking a remove account button.) You can contact us directly with requests to correct, erase, restrict, remove, or to object to, your personal information. If you do not want us to process and/or access your personal information, you may be unable to use some of our Services.

7.2       	Failure to adhere to any of the terms of this Agreement and/or any other applicable agreements, rules, policies or applicable laws may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account and use of any and all of the Services and you may not be entitled to any refunds for any Services which are no longer available to you as a result.

7.3       	We may close your Account if it has not been used for at least 24 months, but we are under no obligation to do so. You agree that Democrats Abroad has a legitimate interest in maintaining your Voter Account to ensure you may utilize VFA Services until such time as you inform us that you wish to remove your Account.

**7.4      After your account is closed, you will not be able to access your account nor use the Services associated with that account. **

 

**8. 	Your conduct when using your Account or VFA Services**

8.1 	When using your Account and the Services (including but not limited to your participation in virtual communities or communicating with the Help Desk), you must behave decently, respectfully and with consideration for Democrats Abroad and other users (who may be minors).

This is statistical data about our user’s browsing, actions, patterns, and device and does not identify any individual (unless otherwise deemed as personal data or personally identifiable information pursuant to applicable law or regulation).

The collection and storage of the above data is solely for the purposes of facilitating the existing functionality of the Services, assisting Democrats Abroad in assessing improvements to its Services and for digital management purposes. 

19.2     	Democrats Abroad may also collect personal information from you when you register for an account and/or where you use an SNS to register your account, in which case we shall extract the personal information you have provided to the SNS from the account you have with the applicable SNS and use that information to create your account. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. You hereby consent to our access to and collection of such personal information about you.

**20. 	Limits on our liability and your rights**

20.1    	To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, you expressly agree that the use of the Services is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, **all Services are provided on an "as is" and “as available” basis** with all faults and without warranty of any kind, and **Democrats Abroad hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the services, **either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, or accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement of third party rights.

No oral or written information or advice given by Democrats Abroad or its authorized representative(s) shall create a warranty. 

20.2     At some point in the future, certain features of the Services may go out of date, and Democrats Abroad makes no commitment to update or continue operating such aspects of the Services. The disclaimers of liability contained in this section apply to any damages or injury caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of the Services, whether for breach of contract, tortious behavior, negligence, or under any other cause of action. The use of the Services or the downloading or other acquisition of any materials and user content through or in connection with the Services is done at your own discretion and risk and with your agreement that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your device or loss of data that results from such activities. 

20.3     Democrats Abroad makes no representations about the suitability of the information contained in the Services. The information and related graphics published as part of the Services may include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors.  You understand and agree that temporary interruption of the Services may occur as normal events. You further understand and agree that we have no control over third party networks you may access in the course of the use of the Services, and therefore, delays and disruption of other network transmissions are completely beyond Democrats Abroad’s control. 

**20.4    You acknowledge and agree that your exclusive remedy for any dispute with Democrats Abroad is to stop using the Services. **In no case shall any liability of Democrats Abroad to you exceed the amount that you paid to Democrats Abroad or its affiliates and/or designees for the applicable feature of the Services giving rise to any such liability.  In no event shall Democrats Abroad or its affiliates be liable to you or any third party for any special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind, or any damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, those resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and on any theory of liability, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Services, including damages to property, loss of goodwill, device failure or malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law, damages for personal injuries, even if Democrats Abroad has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  

**20.5	No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. **

**   **

20.6	Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Democrats Abroad and its affiliates shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

 

**21. 	Miscellaneous**

If any part of the Agreement is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of the Agreement or related rights shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

21.3	*Assignment.* Democrats Abroad may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time.  Notwithstanding, you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under the Agreement without Democrats Abroad’s express prior written consent.

21.4	*Limitations on Our Performance of this Agreement*. Our performance of the Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Agreement is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by Democrats Abroad with respect to such use. In addition to any excuse provided by applicable law, we shall be excused from liability for non-delivery or delay in delivery of the Services arising from any event beyond our reasonable control, whether or not foreseeable by either party, including but not limited to, labor disturbance, war, terrorism, fire, denial of service attack, internet outages, accident, adverse weather, governmental act or regulation, and other causes or events beyond our reasonable control, whether or not similar to those which are enumerated above.

21.5     	*Third Party Beneficiaries.* Nothing in this Agreement gives or claims to give to any third party any benefit or right to enforce any term of this Agreement, and, to the extent permitted by law, any provisions of law that establish benefits or rights of third parties are expressly excluded.

21.7     	*Amendment. *This Agreement applies to all users of VFA Services, depending on the manner in which each user chooses to interact with the VFA website. Democrats Abroad reserves the right to amend or modify this Agreement at any time, in any manner, without any liability to Democrats Abroad and at Democrats Abroad’s sole discretion, provided that users shall be given reasonable notice of any changes that materially limit or restrict their rights under previous versions of this Agreement. **When we amend our Terms of Service, the VFA Privacy Policy, or the VFA Cookie Policy, you consent to receiving "re-permissioning" communications from us. In other words, we may contact you by email to inform you of the amendment and seek your affirmative consent to the amended terms. **With respect to any individual user, this Agreement may not be amended or varied except in a writing signed by Democrats Abroad. Although we understand that electronic or digital signatures are increasingly viewed as the equivalent of traditional written signatures, for these purposes a signature or “signed” writing or written agreement shall not include an electronic or digital signature. 

**21.8     	****_Choice of Law and Forum._**** This Agreement is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the District of Columbia (United States of America) without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws. In the event of a claim by Democrats Abroad against you, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the District of Columbia (United States of America). In the event of a claim by you against Democrats Abroad, its officers, employees, volunteers, affiliates or licensors, you agree to file your claim in, and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of, the courts located in the District of Columbia (United States of America).**
