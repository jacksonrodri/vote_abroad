We arenâ€™t able to provide tax advice, but there might be state income tax consequences if you indicate on your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) that you "intend to return". If you have any concerns, you may wish to consult a tax professional.

Because the legal requirements to establish "residence" or "domicile" for tax purposes are determined by state law and the specific facts of your life, it is important that you seek advice on these matters from your tax professional. Even if registering to vote in state and local elections is not sufficient on its own to make you liable for state taxes, other factors such as maintaining a state driver's license or maintaining a mail forwarding address at a relative's home may make you liable for state taxes.
