It is up to you to decide which category to choose.

If you chose “intend to return” you don't have to have a set date of return and it doesn't have to be within a set time frame, but you need an intention to do so at some time in the future. If you indicate you “intend to return”, you will receive a Federal ballot (US President, US Senate and US House of Representatives) and almost every state will also send a ballot to vote in State elections (Governor, State Legislature, etc).. But please be aware that there may be state income tax consequences if you chose “intend to return.” We can’t give tax advice, so if you have any concerns about that you should talk to a tax professional.

If you chose “return is uncertain”, you will receive a Federal ballot and some states will also allow overseas voters who indicate their “return is uncertain” to vote in State elections.
