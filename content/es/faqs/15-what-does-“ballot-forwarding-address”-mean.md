We strongly recommend that voters opt to receive their blank ballot via email/online or fax rather than mail. But, if you decide to request your blank ballot be sent to you via postal mail, you can designate a “ballot forwarding address” if you don’t wish to receive mail at your current (non-US) mailing address. This is useful for voters who may be moving or travelling before ballots are due to come out or do not have a fixed non-US address. You may use any non-US address that you trust to receive and hold your blank ballot, including a mailbox facility or a University Study Abroad office.
