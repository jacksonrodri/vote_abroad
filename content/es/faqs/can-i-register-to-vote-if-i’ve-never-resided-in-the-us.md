Yes. As a US citizen living abroad, you can submit the Federal Post Card Application to register to vote and request your ballot even though you have never resided in the US. On the form, you can can chose “I have never lived in the United States” as your voter category.

For your “voting address,” use the address of the last place your US citizen parent lived in the US. (If both of your parents are US citizens, you may use the last US address of either US parent.)

Please note that 14 states do not allow US citizens who have never resided in the US to register to vote in their jurisdiction. This effectively disenfranchises US citizens who otherwise are otherwise entitled to vote and also incur all the responsibilities of being a US citizen, such as filing tax returns and registering for the military draft. The US government website to register to vote from abroad (www.fvap.gov) doesn't list the “never lived” option for the 14 states that exclude these voters and votefromabroad.org also excludes this option. If you are a US citizen who has never lived in the US and are registering to vote in one of these states, then as a a non-military overseas voter, you should choose as your voter type that you either “intend to return” or that your “return is uncertain.”

The 14 states that do not allow US citizens who have never resided in the US to register to vote in their jurisdiction are:

Alabama

Arkansas

Florida

Idaho

Illinois (non-military)

Indiana

Louisiana

Maryland

Mississippi

Missouri

Montana

Pennsylvania

Texas

Utah
