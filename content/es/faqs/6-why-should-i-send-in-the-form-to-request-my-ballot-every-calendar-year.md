An FPCA form, sent in the calendar year of an election, protects your ballot at the federal level in case of a recount.

As an overseas voter, you need to send in the form to request your ballot every calendar year in which you wish to vote.

Under Federal law, states are only required to send out your ballot if you submit the form to request it that calendar year--even if you're a registered voter. Some states are more generous and will send ballots without an annual request, but others are very strict. So we advise all overseas voters to be safe and send it in each year. You don't want to miss your chance to vote!

Overseas voters use the same form (the Federal Post Card Application or FPCA) to both register to vote initially and to request a ballot each year. But the FPCA is only one page and you can fill it out online at www.votefromabroad.org. And the one form will cover you for all elections in the calendar year: Primary, General and Special Elections that you may otherwise not be aware of. Here’s what you need to do :

1. Go to www.votefromabroad.org, click on “Start Here” and follow the prompts. 
2. Print out and sign the form.
3. Return the form to your Local Election Official by mail, email or fax, using information in the Instructions from the website. (The email, phone and fax information is on a separate page from the mailing address. Submission methods and deadlines vary by state. The info for your state is included in the Instructions)

If you have any questions while filling out the form, the website has an online chat box (the orange square in the lower right corner of the screen).

And after you send in your FPCA, be sure to check with your Local Election Official that they received it and will be sending a ballot to you. The applicable contact information will be in the Instructions from votefromabroad.org when you print out the form. You can also look up the contact information for your Local Election Official here: www.votefromabroad.org/vote/eod.htm?submission=true

Please send in your form right away to get your ballot for the 2018 elections!
