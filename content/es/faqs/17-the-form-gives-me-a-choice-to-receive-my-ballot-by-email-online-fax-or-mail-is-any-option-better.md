  The form gives me a choice to receive my ballot by email/online, fax or mail. Is any option better?

Yes, we strongly recommend that voters request their ballots be sent to them electronically, that is, either via email/online or via fax.

Remember this is the blank ballot coming to you, so there are no privacy concerns. Selecting electronic delivery means you will get your ballot almost immediately after it is sent to you. You donâ€™t have to worry about the ballot being delayed or lost while coming in the mail. Particularly in countries with poor, slow or non-existent mail service, receiving a blank ballot electronically can make the difference in getting your voted ballot back by the election deadline.
