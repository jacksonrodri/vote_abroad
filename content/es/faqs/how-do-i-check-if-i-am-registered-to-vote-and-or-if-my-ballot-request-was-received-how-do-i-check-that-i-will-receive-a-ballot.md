The most reliable way to verify you will be receiving a ballot this calendar year is to email or call your Local Election Official. You can look up the contact information for your Local Election Official here: www.votefromabroad.org/vote/eod.htm?submission=true

Most states also provide a website where you can check to verify your voter status, but it is not always up to date. To find your state’s website, Google “[state] verify voter registration.”
