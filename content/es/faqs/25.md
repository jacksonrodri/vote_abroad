We aren’t able to provide tax advice, but every U.S. citizen--regardless where they live--is required to file a federal income tax return to report their worldwide income each year. Registering to vote does not change that requirement. However, if you are not currently up-to-date with your U.S. tax returns, you may wish to consult a tax professional about the “streamlined filing” program currently run by the IRS. Here’s an IRS link that may be helpful, and here’s another.
