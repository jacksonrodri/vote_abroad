Getting your voted ballot to your state by the deadline can be difficult if you must mail it from outside the U.S., but there are things you can do:

* Request your state send your blank ballot to you by Email/Online or Fax--you’ll get it almost immediately after it becomes available. For the November General Election, overseas ballots typically go out around the third week of September (45 days before the election)
* Fill out and return your ballot right away. Or, have your Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB) ready to mail in as soon as overseas ballots are available 45 days before the election (around the third week of September for the November General Election). For more information about using a FWAB, please see [FAQ #24](/faqs/24) (“**It’s Getting Close To The Election And I Haven’t Received My Blank Ballot Yet; What Should I Do?**”)
* Contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate about using the diplomatic mail pouch to send in your voted ballot. Mailing is free if you use the postage-paid mailing template (available at: </envelopes>). Inquire early! Your Embassy or Consulate may have restrictions as to when it will accept voted ballots and the time lag to the U.S. can be significant.
* Check pricing and requirements for express mail services (such as FedEx, DHL, UPS, etc.).
