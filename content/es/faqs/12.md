If you elect to start VoteFromAbroad (VFA) by providing your Email Address or Mobile Phone Number, VFA can save some of your information so you will not have to re-type it when you fill out the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in the future. (VFA will never save sensitive information, such as your Social Security Number). Providing an email address or mobile phone number is an added security measure; it allows VFA to send a code that limits access to your information.

If you’d prefer not to save your information or don’t want to bother with using a security code, just click on “start an anonymous session”. You’ll get right to the form and, when you close the website, all data will be deleted.
