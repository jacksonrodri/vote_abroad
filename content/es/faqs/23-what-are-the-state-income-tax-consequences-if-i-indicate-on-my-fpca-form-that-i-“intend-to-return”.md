      10. I’M FILLING OUT MY FORM, HOW DO I KNOW IF I SHOULD CHOOSE “INTEND TO RETURN” OR THAT “MY RETURN IS UNCERTAIN”?

Please be aware that if you say you "intend to return" that might have state income tax consequences. We don't give tax advice, so if you have any concerns about that you should talk to a tax professional.
