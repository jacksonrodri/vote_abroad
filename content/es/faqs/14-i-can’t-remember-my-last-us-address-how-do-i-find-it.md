If you don't remember your US voting address (that is, the last residence address in the US), here are some ideas to try to find that information:

1. If you were registered to vote, check your state's website to see if your voter registration information is still available. It may include your voting address.

2. Look for old documents that might have your US street address, such as letters, address books, birth certificate or tax returns.

3. Ask relatives and friends if they remember your old address.

4. If you have a general location but no street address, use Google Earth to get as close as you can to look for a street address.

5. If you know the county where it was located, call the Local Election Official for the area and describe the location. They may be able to help find the address. You can find contact information for Local Election Officials here: https://www.votefromabroad.org/vote/eod.htm?submission=true
