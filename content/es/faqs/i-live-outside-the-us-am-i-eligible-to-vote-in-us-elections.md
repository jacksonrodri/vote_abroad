US citizens living outside the US **can** vote in US elections as overseas absentee voters! You must be at least 18 years old, and otherwise eligible to register to vote in your state. Your voting state is the last place you lived before you left the US (or before your US parent left the US if you’ve never resided in the US). It does not matter if you were not registered to vote before you left the US, or if you’ve never voted before or how long you have lived outside the US.

All US citizens may vote in Federal Elections, that is, President, US Senator and US House of Representatives. In addition, many states allow at least some of the overseas voters in their state to participate in State and Local Elections (such as Governor, State Legislature, Mayor). Please see below for more information about voting in State and Local Elections.

Federal law guarantees the right of all US citizens living outside the US to vote under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voting Act (UOCAVA), and the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (MOVE Act) which amended UOCAVA to expand its protections.
