VoteFromAbroad.org es una herramienta de registro de votantes no partidista provista como servicio público por Democrats Abroad.

Democrats Abroad se compromete a proteger su privacidad en línea. Democrats Abroad no conserva ninguna información confidencial de identificación personal, como su número de seguro social, el número de licencia del conductor o el número de pasaporte. Democrats Abroad conserva datos agregados para propósitos estadísticos. Democrats Abroad no utilizará ninguna información que se nos proporcione aquí para ningún otro fin a menos que primero obtengamos su consentimiento.

Democrats Abroad will hold any information you provide us here with the utmost care and will only use it in ways to which you have consented: for preparation of the voter registration materials in all cases; and, according to your expressed consent, for voting reminders and information, for contact from Democratic candidates, or for membership in Democrats Abroad, as the case may be.

All personal information and other unique identifiers required by law for voter registration that are submitted in the process of registering to vote are used to produce the voter registration form to send to your local or state election officials. If you opt in to join Democrats Abroad, you will have given us permission to transfer your name, contact information, birth date, and voting state information to the Democrats Abroad membership database. For information about the privacy policy for personal data about members of Democrats Abroad see https://www.democratsabroad.org/privacy_statement.

Democrats Abroad does not share member information with Democratic candidates or Democratic Party organizations without your explicit consent. If you opt to receive information from Democratic candidates, you will have given us permission to transfer your name, contact information, and voting state information to the campaigns of Democratic candidates and the associated Democratic state parties.

Like any other voter in the U.S., once you mail in your voter registration application form to your local or state election officials, it becomes a matter of public record and is available for inspection and use by legitimate candidates for public office and their campaign organizations as well as by others who satisfy the requirements of the State law governing its use.

Any information that you provide will be collected and maintained directly on servers located in the xx and operated by Democrats Abroad. If you are located outside the United States, any information you provide will be transferred to the United States. Democrats Abroad is committed to maintaining your information with all legally required protections. You should know, however, that the general level of protection for personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other countries.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, the information we have collected from you online, the practices of this site, or your interaction with this website, send email to: Help@votefromabroad.org or contact us by postal mail at:
