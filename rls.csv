I prefer to use the link that's on the page currently rather than the one you had (https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/) as that one requires a CA state ID, which most overseas voters don't have. If you go to the individual counties, many only require a SSN.-Heidi "
7,CO,Good,Good,https://myballot.sos.colorado.gov/app/home,https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/UOCAVA.html,"Current link for VFA ""Where is my ballot?"" takes you to voter/parish information/registration (like CT). However, if you search the state webpage, there is an icon for ""Track my ballot"". When you select the state ""track my ballot"" icon, it takes you to voter parish information. Does this mean we should not correct the VFA? Would you prefer the landing page to be ""track my ballot"" on the state website or voter/parish information? Let's keep as is. I had a CO voter check and when you use the website, it shows both voter reg and ballot info. So even if people are confused when they see it, when they try it it'll work. -Heidi"

If you select that icon you end up at the check my voter registration page. This leads me to believe they are one in the same. However, most likely if a state website does not direct you to that page for track your ballot then voter registration and track your ballot is different. Finally, watch the titles of the pages. Sometimes they will say, ""to track your ballot or check voter status fill out this form."" Hope this helps. Current link for ""Where is my ballot?"" takes you to voter registration page, but it is possible the ballot can be tracked as well. Let's keep as is. A lot of times the Voter Registration page will also give you our ballot status (eg., ""yes you're registered and your ballot went out on this date"") - Heidi"

Neither Kelli nor I could find a ""track my ballot"" for Kansas. The government website does not allow to check if you are registered. The link takes you to a private organization. It looks like http://www.voteks.org/ is the state's website, not a private organization. And the same website for voter registration search also has ""advance ballot"" to view the status of your ballot if it was received. I think that works. - Heidi"
